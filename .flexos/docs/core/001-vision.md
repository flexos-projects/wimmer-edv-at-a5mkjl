# Vision & Strategy

> This document defines the strategic vision, mission, and core business objectives for the Wimmer Consulting GmbH digital presence.

## Business Profile

- **Business Name**: Wimmer Consulting GmbH
- **Industry**: IT Consulting and Services
- **Mission**: To be the strategic IT partner for Austrian medium-sized enterprises (KMU), guiding them through digital transformation with expert consulting, modern technology solutions, and reliable support.

## Problem & Solution

- **The Problem**: Austrian KMUs struggle to navigate complex IT landscapes. They often fall behind on digital transformation due to outdated systems (like legacy ERPs), increasing security vulnerabilities, and a lack of in-house expertise for critical projects like cloud migration and business process optimization.
- **Our Solution**: Wimmer Consulting provides tailored, end-to-end IT solutions. We deliver everything from strategic consulting and modern ERP implementation (Microsoft Dynamics 365) to secure cloud infrastructure, managed IT services, and custom software development. Our goal is to enable clients to increase efficiency, security, and competitiveness.

## Target Users

- **Markus, the CEO**: The CEO of a mid-sized manufacturing company. He is concerned with ROI, business process efficiency, and long-term strategy. He needs a trusted IT partner who understands his business goals and can align technology to achieve them.
- **Sabine, the IT Manager**: The Head of IT at a services firm. She is overwhelmed with managing legacy systems, daily support tasks, and escalating security threats. She needs a reliable partner for modernization projects, managed services, and specialized expertise in areas like AS/400 or Veeam.

## Unique Value Proposition (UVP)

We combine decades of deep expertise in complex enterprise systems, including Microsoft Dynamics and IBM i (AS/400), with a forward-looking approach to cloud, security, and custom development. We don't just sell technology; we build long-term partnerships to solve our clients' core business challenges.

## Competitive Landscape

Our competitors include local IT service providers in Upper Austria (Linz, Wels), national IT consulting firms, and specialized ERP implementers. We differentiate ourselves through our unique combination of legacy system expertise (AS/400) and modern cloud/ERP solutions, coupled with a highly personalized consulting approach tailored for the Austrian KMU segment.
