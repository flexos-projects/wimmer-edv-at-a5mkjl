# Project Origin: Website Resurrection

> This document records the origin of the Wimmer Consulting GmbH website rebuild project, which began as a resurrection of a legacy website.

## Project Source

This project was initiated to modernize and rebuild the digital presence of Wimmer Consulting GmbH. The primary source of information was a technical analysis and scrape of the existing website.

- **Project Type**: Website Resurrection
- **Source Type**: `website_scrape`
- **Source URL**: `https://wimmer-edv.at`
- **Pages Crawled**: 10

## Key Insights from Original Site

The analysis of the original Wix-based website revealed several key insights that informed the rebuild strategy:

1.  **Outdated Technology and Content**: The content referenced obsolete technologies such as Microsoft Dynamics AX 4.0, Microsoft Office 2003, and the .NET Framework without context to modern equivalents. The overall presentation was dated.
2.  **Strong Core Competencies**: The company has deep, valuable expertise in core areas, particularly Microsoft Dynamics ERP, network services, and crucially, legacy IBM AS/400 (iSeries) systems. This legacy expertise is a significant market differentiator.
3.  **Content and SEO Gaps**: There was a complete lack of modern content marketing. Missing elements included a blog, case studies, detailed service pages for cloud or modern security, and any mention of Managed Services.
4.  **Dated Design**: The design relied on standard system fonts (Arial, Verdana) and a basic color palette, failing to convey the professional, authoritative brand voice the company aims for.

## Decisions for Rebuild

Based on the analysis, the following core decisions were made for the new website:

- **Strategic Re-platforming**: Move from Wix to a modern, performance-oriented static site generator (Astro) to improve page speed, SEO, and maintainability.
- **Content Modernization**: Update all service offerings to reflect current technologies (e.g., Microsoft Dynamics 365, Azure Cloud Services) while retaining and highlighting the unique expertise in AS/400 modernization.
- **New Site Architecture**: Introduce new, crucial pages including a modern homepage with a clear value proposition, a blog for thought leadership, a case studies section to build trust, and detailed, solution-oriented service pages.
- **Implement a Design System**: Develop a new visual identity with a professional color scheme (#0056B3 primary), modern typography (Montserrat for headings, Open Sans for body), and a consistent component library to ensure a polished user experience.
- **Launch an SEO-driven Content Strategy**: Actively target identified keyword clusters and content gaps by launching a blog with relevant topics for Austrian KMUs, and optimizing all pages for search engines.
